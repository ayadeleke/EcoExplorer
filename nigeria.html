                        <h2>Federal Republic of Nigeria</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nigeria, officially known as the Federal Republic of Nigeria, occupies a prominent position in West Africa, where it is nestled between the Sahel to the north and the Gulf of Guinea 
                            to the south, lapped by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Encompassing a landmass of 923,769 square kilometers (356,669 sq mi), Nigeria stands as a vast and diverse nation, 
                            teeming with cultural richness and natural beauty.
                            With a population exceeding 230 million, Nigeria proudly holds the title of the most populous country in Africa and ranks as the world's sixth-most populous nation. 
                            Its borders are shared with Niger to the north, Chad to the northeast, Cameroon to the east, and Benin to the west, fostering a sense of regional interconnectedness and diversity.
                            Nigeria operates as a federal republic, consisting of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where the bustling capital city of Abuja is located. 
                            However, it is the vibrant city of Lagos that takes center stage as Nigeria's largest metropolis, standing as one of the world's largest metropolitan areas and the largest in Africa.
                            Beyond its bustling urban centers, Nigeria's landscape is a mosaic of diverse ecosystems, ranging from lush rainforests to expansive savannas. 
                            Its natural wonders provide habitat to a rich array of flora and fauna, contributing to the country's ecological significance and biodiversity.
                            </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Nigeria, nestled in the heart of West Africa, boasts a tapestry of geographical diversity, from lush rainforests to expansive savannas and sprawling coastal plains. 
                            Its history is a rich mosaic, woven with the threads of ancient civilizations like the Nok culture and powerful empires such as the Oyo and Benin kingdoms. 
                            Colonized by the British in the late 19th century, Nigeria gained independence in 1960, heralding a new era of self-governance and aspirations for progress.<br>
                            Blessed with abundant natural resources, Nigeria's economy has long been fueled by its oil wealth. However, efforts are underway to diversify the economy, 
                            tapping into sectors like agriculture, telecommunications, and manufacturing to unlock new avenues for growth and development. The country's vast biodiversity, 
                            encompassing a myriad of tree species like the towering mahogany and mighty baobab, alongside a rich tapestry of wildlife ranging from elephants and 
                            lions to chimpanzees and diverse bird species, presents significant opportunities for ecotourism and conservation initiatives.<br>
                            Among these are several iconic animals and plants that are classified as threatened or endangered due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching, pollution, and climate change.
                            One notable example is the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), whose populations have dwindled over the years due to poaching for ivory and loss of habitat. 
                            Despite conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and anti-poaching measures, elephants continue to face significant threats in Nigeria.</p><br>
                            <p>Similarly, the majestic lion (Panthera leo), once widespread across the country, has seen its numbers decline drastically, primarily due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict. 
                            Efforts to protect and restore lion populations are underway, but the species remains vulnerable to extinction in Nigeria.
                            The Nigerian-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) is another species at risk, facing habitat destruction from deforestation and illegal hunting for bushmeat. 
                            As one of the most endangered subspecies of chimpanzee, urgent action is needed to safeguard its future in Nigeria.<br>
                            In addition to charismatic megafauna, Nigeria is home to a diverse array of plant species facing threats. The Nigerian ebony (Diospyros crassiflora), 
                            prized for its valuable timber, is under pressure from logging and habitat degradation. Similarly, the African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) and 
                            other valuable timber species are at risk of overexploitation.</p><br>
                            <p>Conservation organizations, government agencies, and local communities are working together to address these threats and protect Nigeria's biodiversity. 
                            Initiatives range from the establishment of protected areas and wildlife corridors to community-based conservation projects and sustainable livelihood programs. 
                            Education and awareness campaigns are also crucial in fostering a culture of conservation and promoting the sustainable use of natural resources.<br>
                            Culturally, Nigeria is a melting pot, home to over 250 ethnic groups, each with its own unique languages, traditions, and customs. 
                            This diversity is celebrated through vibrant festivals, colorful attire, and an eclectic culinary landscape. English serves as the official language, 
                            facilitating communication across ethnic boundaries while preserving indigenous languages.</p><br>
                            <p>In the realm of politics, Nigeria operates as a federal republic, with a presidential system of government. 
                            Elections are hotly contested affairs, reflecting the vibrancy of the country's democratic process. Challenges such as insecurity, corruption, and infrastructural deficits loom large, 
                            yet Nigeria remains resilient, with a burgeoning youth population driving innovation and entrepreneurship.
                            Opportunities abound in Nigeria, from investment in infrastructure and technology to harnessing renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable agriculture. 
                            The country's strategic location, burgeoning middle class, and dynamic market make it an attractive destination for local and foreign investors alike. 
                            With the right policies and investments, Nigeria has the potential to emerge as a beacon of prosperity and progress, not just for its citizens but for the wider African continent.

                        20m. It is valued for timber and as an icon of traditional beliefs. In parts of Nigeria, people believe that iroko 
                        was the first tree God showed to human beings and that it brings forth souls for the newborn. A strong man may be 
                        given the nickname Iroko. Medicinal uses are important locally. The bark has analgesic effects, and the gum that 
                        oozes from cracks in the bark is a good antiseptic.

                    <p>African birch, scientifically known as Anogeissus leiocarpa, is a tree species native to the African continent, 
                        particularly found in West Africa. It belongs to the Combretaceae family and is sometimes referred to as the 
                        "African birch" due to its resemblance to birch trees in appearance. African birch trees are known for their 
                        tall stature, reaching heights of up to 30 meters (about 100 feet). They have distinctive peeling bark and produce 
                        small, inconspicuous flowers. The wood of African birch is valued for its strength and is used in various 
                        applications, including construction, furniture making, and traditional medicine.</p>

                    <h2>Neem</h2>
                    <p>Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, margosa, nimtree, or Indian lilac, is a fast-growing tree in the mahogany 
                        family Meliaceae. It typically reaches heights of 15–20 meters (49–66 feet), occasionally growing up to 35–40 meters 
                        (115–131 feet). Neem is evergreen but sheds many leaves during dry winters. Its wide-spreading branches form a 
                        fairly dense, roundish crown, reaching diameters of 20–25 meters (66–82 feet). The opposite, pinnate leaves are 
                        20–40 centimeters (8–16 inches) long, with 20 to 30 medium to dark green leaflets measuring 3–8 centimeters 
                        in length.

                        thicker, darker mane is often associated with better health in the cat. Unlike most other cat species, both male 
                        and female lions are capable of roaring, a vocalization that can be heard from distances of up to 8 kilometers away.</p>

                    <p>African elephants are the largest terrestrial mammals on Earth. They are classified into two subspecies: 
                        the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant. Bush elephants are generally larger, with curved tusks, 
                        while forest elephants are darker in color and have straighter tusks that point downward. Both subspecies play 
                        crucial roles in their respective ecosystems and are vital to the health of African habitats.</p>

                    <p>Giraffes, the tallest mammals, have unique adaptations for reaching high vegetation. Their elastic blood vessels 
                        and specialized valves prevent fainting when they raise or lower their heads rapidly. Their "horns" are actually 
                        skin-covered knobs, not true horns, protecting against injuries. Despite having the same number of neck vertebrae 
                        as humans, their elongated bones enable an impressive neck length of up to 2.4 meters.</p>

                    <p>Leopards are characterized by their distinctive coat patterns, which vary among the nine recognized subspecies. 
                        In warm, dry habitats, their coats tend to be tawny or light yellow, while in dense forests, they may appear 
                        reddish-orange. Their coats are adorned with dark, irregular spots known as rosettes. Interestingly, the shape of 
                        these rosettes differs between subspecies: they are circular in East African leopards and square in Southern African

                        and western Arabia throughout Africa except for the Sahara and rainforest regions. It is responsible for causing 
                        the most snakebite fatalities in Africa owing to various factors, such as its wide distribution, frequent 
                        occurrence in highly populated regions, and aggressive disposition.Like all other vipers, it is venomous. 
                        Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies.
